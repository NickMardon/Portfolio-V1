# Portfolio-V1
This is the first version of my developer portfolio site.  This 3 page website was made using HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap as well as assets from google fonts, pexels stock images, and font awesome icons.  

The purpose of this site is to showcase my front end development skills, host links to my current projects, and provide contact information to connect with other developers and perspective employers and clients.
